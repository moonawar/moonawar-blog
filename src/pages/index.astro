				thoughts ðŸª„ <br/> <br/>

				In here youâ€™ll probably see: <br/>
				My projects development
				Lessonâ€™s learned from my personal experience
				Editorial text
				Creative writing <?> â€” short story, poetry. Weâ€™ll see about that~ <br/><br/>

				I also made the website in two languages â€” Bahasa Indonesia and English 
				â€” to make it more accessible for everyone ðŸ™Œ <br/><br/>

				All of the things i write here are purely my opinions that have been 
				influenced by many sources and might be bias. Please donâ€™t take it 
				for granted!
